Crypto Analysis and Prediction System
Personal Project | Python, CCXT, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Excel

Developed a cryptocurrency analysis and prediction tool that retrieves real-time and historical data from multiple exchanges using the CCXT API.

Implemented data cleaning, validation, and metric calculations with optimized pandas operations, ensuring high-quality datasets.

Built and trained a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction (high/low), with cross-validation and feature importance analysis.

Designed a modular codebase with logging, validators, and unit tests, improving maintainability and scalability.

Exported processed results to Excel for reporting and visualization.

Applied best practices including error handling, efficient memory management, and performance optimization.

Explored future improvements: adding more exchanges, technical indicators, caching, parallelization, and ensemble ML methods.
